# Sleep Quality

Quantity isn’t enough. Quality matters more for restoration:

- Minimize light exposure before bed (screens, bright lights)
- Maintain a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment
- Establish a wind-down routine (meditation, reading, stretching)
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime
