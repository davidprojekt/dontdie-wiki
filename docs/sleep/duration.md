# Sleep Duration

Epidemiological studies show a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and mortality risk:

- **7–8 hours** per night is optimal for most adults.
- Less than 7 hours: increased risk of chronic disease and early mortality.
- More than 9 hours: also associated with higher mortality risk.

### Tips to Achieve Optimal Duration
- Set consistent bedtime and wake-up time.
- Track your sleep to understand your natural patterns.
- Adjust gradually: shift your bedtime by 15–30 minutes if needed.
