# Tracking Sleep

Measuring your sleep is key to improvement:

- **Wearables**: Oura Ring, WHOOP, Apple Watch
- **Apps**: Sleep Cycle, AutoSleep
- **Manual journaling**: track bedtime, wake time, and subjective quality

Focus on:
- Total sleep time
- Sleep latency (how long it takes to fall asleep)
- Sleep fragmentation (number of awakenings)
