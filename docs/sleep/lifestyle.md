# Lifestyle Factors Affecting Sleep

- **Diet**: Avoid heavy meals 2–3 hours before bed; limit caffeine late in the day.
- **Exercise**: Regular activity improves sleep, but avoid high-intensity exercise right before bedtime.
- **Circadian alignment**: Expose yourself to natural light during the day and dim lights in the evening.
- **Consistency**: Keep sleep and wake times consistent, even on weekends.
