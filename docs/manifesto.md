# The Manifesto

**"Don't Die" is not just a slogan. It is an algorithm for decision-making.**

For most of history, health was a matter of luck or superstition. Today, it is an engineering problem. The goal of this wiki is to operationalize the science of longevity into actionable steps.

## The Core Philosophy

### 1. Your Body is a System
We treat the human body not as a mystery, but as a complex biological machine. Like any machine, it requires maintenance, clean fuel, and damage repair. When we neglect the system, entropy takes over (aging/disease). When we maintain the system, we can slow or reverse that entropy.

### 2. Data Over Dogma
We do not care about trends, ancient wisdom, or "what feels right" unless it is backed by data.
* **Measure:** We look at biomarkers (blood, sleep data, organs).
* **Intervene:** We apply a protocol.
* **Measure Again:** Did the data improve?

### 3. Gradualism
You cannot change your entire life overnight. This wiki is built on the concept of **compounding marginal gains**. Fixing your sleep by 10% creates the energy to fix your diet, which creates the clarity to start exercising.

## Our Mission

We believe that extending healthy human lifespan is the most important moral imperative of our time. By democratizing the information on *how* to do it, we empower anyone, regardless of budget or background, to take control of their biology.

**The goal is simple: Don't Die.**
