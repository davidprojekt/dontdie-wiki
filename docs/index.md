# Welcome to DontDie.wiki

**The clearest step-by-step guide on the internet for living longer and healthier.**

Health advice today is noisy, contradictory, and often hidden behind paywalls or influencers. **DontDie.wiki** is different. We are an open-source community building the ultimate manual for the human body.

We strip away the noise to provide a prioritized algorithm for health—starting with the simplest changes that yield the highest returns.

## How to Use This Wiki

This guide is structured like a video game leveling system. You don't fight the boss (advanced experimental therapies) before you learn to walk (sleep and nutrition).

* **[Level 0: The Manifesto](manifesto.md)** – Why we are doing this and the philosophy of "Don't Die."
* **Level 1: The Basics** – High-ROI habits you can start today for free (Sleep hygiene, Light exposure, Feeding windows).
* **Level 2: Nutrition & Fuel** – Evidence-based dietary protocols.
* **Level 3: Measurement** – How to track your biomarkers and prove what works.
* **Level 4: Optimization** – Supplements and advanced interventions.

## Why Open Source?

Biology is complex, but the instructions shouldn't be. By hosting this on GitHub, we ensure that:

1.  **It evolves:** As science changes, our protocols change.
2.  **It’s unbiased:** No one is trying to sell you a specific pill here.
3.  **It’s collaborative:** Thousands of brains are better than one.
