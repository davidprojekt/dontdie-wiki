# How to Contribute

**Help us debug the human code.**

This wiki is an open-source project. We need researchers, writers, doctors, and developers to help us build the most accurate health guide in the world.

## What We Need
We are currently looking for contributions in the following areas:

*   **Protocol refinement:** Simplifying complex science into step-by-step instructions.
*   **Citation checks:** Ensuring every claim is backed by PubMed links or reputable studies.
*   **Grammar & Clarity:** Making the wiki accessible to non-native English speakers.

## The Rules (Style Guide)

To maintain quality, please adhere to these three rules:

1.  **Action-Oriented:** Do not just write "Sleep is good." Write "Turn off overhead lights at 8:00 PM."
2.  **Cite Your Sources:** If you make a health claim, link to the study.
3.  **Keep it Simple:** Avoid jargon where simple words will do.

### Keep in Mind

*   **Correlation does not imply causation:** Correlation contains important information, but that doesn't mean its the cause!

## How to Submit Changes

### For Developers (The Git Workflow)
1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** the project to your machine.
3.  Create a **new branch** for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/add-magnesium-protocol`).
4.  Make your changes in Markdown.
5.  **Push** to your branch and submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### For Non-Developers
If you don't know how to code, you can still help!

1.  Go to the **Issues** tab on our GitHub repository.
2.  Click "New Issue."
3.  Describe the content you want to add, the error you found, or the study you think we should include.
4.  Label it as `content-suggestion`.

Together, we can build the standard operating procedure for human health.
